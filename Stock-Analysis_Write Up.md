# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to evaluate the performance of a specific set of stocks and how they performed over a specific year. The analysis from this project can be used to make data-driven decisions regarding which stocks to purchase.  The project was completed uses two separate codes to find and explore how VBA code might be more efficiently.  
### Purpose
The purpose this project was to analyze the total volume and return of a set of stocks over a given year - in this case either 2017 or 2018 but has the flexibility to add in other years of the same stocks, should they become available. The purpose of the project was also to understand how refactoring code has its benefits and challenges.  
## Analysis
The project analyzes two specific parts of the data.  The first analysis sums the total number of stocks traded over the chosen year, by ticker.  This indicates how actively the stocks are traded.  The second analysis calculates the return of the stocks from the first closing cost to the final closing cost, at the ticker level.  

The second 

  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
